Hello.

My primary professional interest is in startup companies that make a difference in the world. I've started five companies, founded four of them, and co-founded two successful non-profits. We've been ranked in the top 500 fastest growing private companies (INC 500) in the US three times in my career so far. I like efficiency, minimalist design, and working in small teams to accomplish difficult tasks.

I've always had a passion for medicine and have kept my Paramedic current through international work and teaching Wilderness/Remote Area medicine. I'm an avid backcountry pilot, skier, climber, hunter, and Tenkara fisherman.
